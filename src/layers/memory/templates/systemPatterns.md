## System Architecture

### High-Level Overview

[Describe the overall system architecture - what are the major components and how do they fit together?]

```
[ASCII diagram or description of architecture]
```

### Architecture Style

**Rationale:** [Why this architecture was chosen]

### Component Overview

#### Component 1: [Name]

- **Purpose:** [What does this component do?]
- **Responsibilities:** [Key responsibilities]
- **Boundaries:** [What it does NOT do]

#### Component 2: [Name]

- **Purpose:** [What does this component do?]
- **Responsibilities:** [Key responsibilities]
- **Boundaries:** [What it does NOT do]

#### Component 3: [Name]

- **Purpose:** [What does this component do?]
- **Responsibilities:** [Key responsibilities]
- **Boundaries:** [What it does NOT do]

## Component Relationships
